	- Error falsely being thrown when a constant (int) is being passed into a function that

No argument function calls are not handled.
Calling a function in a grandparent or older scope may or may not work.

subscripts.p	- <s>Variable decl w/ array type: array stuff ("[<size>]") should come after name. </s>
pointer.p	    - typedef of pointer is wrong, struct needs to be foreward defined, pointers need to print after forward definitions
